## Features

- **Maximization Solver:** Focuses on solving maximization linear programming problems.
- **Web-based Interface:** Use the solver through your web browser without the need for installation.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Our user-friendly interface makes it easy to input your linear programming problem and obtain the optimal solution.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Maximization Simplex Method Solver, simply follow these steps:

1. Visit our website at [MAX_SIMPLEX_SOLVER](https://huggingface.co/spaces/khushpatel2002/Optimization).
2. Input your linear programming problem in the specified format. The solver will guide you through the process.
3. Click the "Submit" button to find the optimal solution.
4. Review the solution.

## Usage

Using the Maximization Simplex Method Solver is straightforward:

1. **Input Your Problem:** Enter your linear programming problem. All equations should already be in standard form, meaning, aside the
   the objective function, the inequality present should be "<=". Each equation should also be separated by a comma.
   ```
    variables          ==> x_1, x_2, ...
    inequality         ==> '<='
    objective function ==> Z
   ```
   As an example
   ```
   Z = 3x_1 + 5x_2 + 4x_3, 2x_1 - 3x_2 <= 8, 2x_2 + 5x_3 <= 10, 3x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 <= 15
   ```

3. **Solve:** Click the "Submit" button to initiate the solver.

4. **Review Solution:** Examine the solution to understand the optimal values of your decision variables and the optimal objective function value.
